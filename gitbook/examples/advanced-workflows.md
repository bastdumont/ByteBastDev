Chain multiple tasks with dependencies and validations.

```bash
python orchestrator/main.py --task "Create React admin panel, FastAPI backend, and connect to MongoDB with tests" --include-tests --output-dir ./output/admin-stack
```

Review the plan with `--dry-run` to adjust details before execution.

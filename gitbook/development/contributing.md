# Contributing

We welcome improvements to code, docs, templates, and integrations.

## Workflow

1) Fork and create a feature branch
2) Write tests and docs
3) Submit a PR with a clear description

## Standards

- Clean code, meaningful names, small functions
- Inline comments for non-obvious logic
- Update README and GitBook sections when behavior changes

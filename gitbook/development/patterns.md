# Architecture Patterns

Core patterns used across the framework.

## Async Orchestration

- Use async tasks with bounded concurrency
- Preserve deterministic ordering via dependency graph

## Configuration Layers

- Defaults → Global YAML → CLI flags

## Error Handling

- Fail fast on criticals, retry on transient

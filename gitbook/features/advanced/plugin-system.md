# Plugin System

Extend the framework with custom capabilities and integrations.

## Concepts

- Discovery: plugins loaded from configured locations
- Contracts: well-defined interfaces for handlers and skills
- Isolation: failures do not crash the core engine

## Example Use Cases

- New MCP server integration
- Custom validators or linters
- Organization-specific code generators
